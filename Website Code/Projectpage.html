    So what is a food desert? According to the United States Department of Agriculture a food desert is an area
    <br> that has limited access to "supermarkets, supercenters, and grocery stores or other sources of healthy
    <br> foods". Numerically, it would be neighborhoods with a poverty rate of above 20% along with being one mile away
    <br> from the nearest grocery store. This would be the reasoning on why families would have to rely more upon unhealthy
    <br> alternative options which could result in health problems down the line. Food desert areas stated on the website is
    <br> a good way of defining areas of low-income neighborhoods. Los Angeles, California is one of the most bustling
    <br> cities in the United States, with beautiful scenery and historical content with lots of culture behind it.
    <br> So taking a look at LA, why are we seeing food deserts extensivly across specific areas in Los Angele?

    California is one of the easiest states to spot the differences in social inequality.
    <br> With the Mean household income standing at $75,235 according to the U.S Census Bureau.
    <br> Along with this data, the percentage of the people in poverty is at 11.8% from a 2019 census.
    <br> Since this data excludes the impacts of the recent pandemic we can surely expect that the poverty <br>
    line has increase well above this number. As we dive deeper into our research we will explore areas with concentrated
    <br> low income and whether access to healthy grocery stores is easy for these families or is it a difficult process to obtain

      By looking at the map above provided to us by the City of Los Angeles we can see a huge concentration of low income

<div class="PovertyRedlining">
<h2 id="PovertyRedlining" style="font-size:25px">Poverty & Redlining</h2>
  <p2 style="font-size:16px">
    <pre>
      Redlining was the practice of enacting racially restrictive zoning in cities, prominent most in the
    <br>  United States and Canada. This involved characterizing various neighborhoods with “residential
    <br>  security maps” showing which areas were more ‘desirable’ for real estate investment. A letter
    <br>  grading system with corresponding colors was used to rank neighborhoods.

    <br>  Areas with an ‘A’ ranking were generally affluent suburbs on the outskirts of cites, highlighted
    <br>  in bright green on maps. Areas with ‘B’ rankings were “still desirable” and marked in blue on
    <br>  maps. Areas with ‘C’ rankings were referred to as “declining” and marked in yellow on maps.
    <br>  Areas with ‘D’ rankings were referred to as “declining” and were marked in bright red on maps;
    <br>  these were older neighborhoods, most often with majority Black populations. While this also
    <br>  affected other nonwhites, as well as Jewish and Irish immigrants; Black Americans were
    <br>  primarily impacted by these policies.
<!-- This to to link the map that we created from mapbox -->
    <iframe width="900px" height="400px" src="Poverty&Redlining.html" title="Map"></iframe>


    <br>  These redlining maps were not produced by the FHA (Federal Housing Administration), they
    <br>  were almost entirely produced by the private sector to meet requirements set by the FHA.
    <br>  Private lenders, small banks, large federally insured banks, and home insurance companies
    <br>  would mostly refuse to provide their services or give home loans to people in yellow and
    <br>  redlined areas.

    <br>  Home ownership is one of the most effective ways for a family to build generational wealth. It
    <br>  is no surprise that redlining had a devastating social and economic impact on Black Americans.
    <br>  South LA is 38% Black, 56.7% Latino, and 2.2% White. Only 36.9% of South LA residents own
    <br>  their home, while 63.1% rent. Overall, low home ownership rates and high poverty rates persist
    <br>  to the present day in historically redlined areas across the United States. Present day
    <br>  gentrification of these areas further increases the cost of living; disproportionally pushing out
    <br>  low income, nonwhite residents out of a neighborhood that their communities were redlined
    <br>  into decades before. There is a strong connection between historical redlining and present-day
    <br>  poverty in these areas, this map helps show that link.    </pre>

    <pre>
    <br>  These food desert areas in South LA are mostly lower income and have much lower car
    <br>  ownership rates. In car dependent Los Angeles, it is difficult to get around without owning a
    <br>  vehicle. Residents of these areas are often limited to stores that they can walk to; there is a lack
    <br>  of supermarkets in South LA that sell healthier foods or fresh produce. Many residents will walk
    <br>  to a nearby convenience store or fast-food place instead since they are often the only options
    <br>  within walking distance. The city of Los Angeles has rapidly expand their rail transit network
    <br>  over the past decade, and plans to expand it further. Rail lines can provide increased mobility to
    <br>  underserved communities and could assist in reducing the severity of food deserts if placed
    <br>  right.

    <br>  The interactive map provided shows the LA metro rail lines with the area of South LA outlined.
    <br>  The metro rail system crosses into the very outskirts of South LA; it is almost like Los Angeles
    <br>  did not want people from this community to ride their rail system. The rail circumnavigates
    <br>  South LA. While it does reach some underserved areas, the rail system mostly connects monied
    <br>  suburbs and wealthy enclaves to Downtown LA; giving car commuters an alternative to
    <br>  congested freeways. Taking cars off the road is still a good thing, but the fact remains that there
    <br>  are many people in LA that don’t own a car at all and we should be taking care of their needs
    <br>  first.

  <p2 style="font-size:16px">
    <pre>
      So overall our findings conclude that their is an correaltion between income and food deserts
  <br>in Los Angeles city. Due to historical redlining data that was used on our maps as well as the
  <br> median income data that we were able to find. Lastly the way the metroline is setup, it is clearly
  <br> blueprinted to stay out of specific neighborhoods

  <p2 style="font-size:16px">
    <pre>
         So going into the brainstorming phase we wanted to make a little inital page since we were presenting to the class.
    <br> After we click the button it was to create a sense of aw, to give a little shock on the website that we designed.
    <br> Going into the main website we have the top navigation bar with the main title and the info included in the website.
    <br> We kind of expected the nav bar to be common sense for the user but it becomes more clear that they are buttons
    <br> when the mouse hover over they change as well as the mouse pointer to a finger pointer.
    <br> We also thought about the color palettes to use for people with color blindness or vision troubles.
    <br> so we chose to go with a color palette with not to much contrast that is seen the same for people with
    <br> either protanopia or deuteranopia.

    <br> This diagram is for our websites and maps composing of rectangles which is the website entity.
    <br> The paralellagram which is the data contained on said entities.
    <br> Finally, diamonds which are the interactive functions on the webpage.
